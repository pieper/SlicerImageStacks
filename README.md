# SlicerImageStacks
Scripted utility to load image stacks (e.g. confocal microscopy) more easily.

## Basic usage
* use file browser to select list of images.
* enter spacing of original image data
* downsample uses 1/2 the pixels in each dimension (so volume is 1/8 size)
* skipping slices reduces the z-resolution
